# Motivation
Waiting in line is boring, frustrating, there’s rarely any comfy seats and there’s always that slight fear someone’s going to try to jump infront of you. It’s a bad start to any restaurant’s customer experience.

We built an online queue app for any business that wants to improve that experience and have an easy way to keep track of and manage their queue. It allows customers to join the queue remotely and enjoy their queueing experience however they please.

# User journey example
You’re starting to get a bit peckish and want to eat at your favourite local restaurant. They use jointheQ so you jump online. You’re greeted by a list of restaurants close by and can immediately see the number of people in their queue, estimated waiting time and the distance from your current location. But you want your favourite. So you search “my favourite restaurant”. You find it and can see there’s 3 groups in the queue with an estimated waiting time of 25 minutes. That’ll do. At the click of a button you’re in the queue whilst still in the comfort of your own home, local park, pub, bar, or favourite tree. A quick glance a few minutes later and you can see there’s now only 1 group in front of you. Perfect. You start to get ready to make your way, looking forward to that one dish they do so well. Another quick glance and your screen has changed, a message telling you your ticket has been called and you can make your way to the restaurant.
You show your ticket on arrival and are immediately seated. No hassle. No queues. Happy days.
